## PHASE 2: DATA LAYER (Days 2-4)

**Goal:** Fetch historical data, build real-time WebSocket, create candles

### 2.1 Historical Data ✅ COMPLETE  
**Original plan:** Create a standalone fetch script
**What we built:** Professional module + test script (better design!)

- [x] api_client.py - Reused existing Delta Exchange API client
- [x] historical_loader.py - Created reusable data loader module
  - Fetches 6-month historical data
  - Outputs to JSON format (improved from original CSV plan)
  - Integrates with data_validator for quality checks
  - Class-based design for easy reuse in later phases
- [x] test_historical_loader.py - Comprehensive test script
  - Tests API connection
  - Validates data quality
  - Can be re-run anytime to refresh data
- [x] Successfully fetched 6 months SOLUSD data (17,281 candles)
- [x] Successfully fetched 6 months AAVEUSD data

**Files created:**
- core/data/historical_loader.py
- scripts/test_historical_loader.py

**Note:** We improved upon the original plan by creating a reusable module 
instead of a standalone script. This follows better software design principles 
and will be useful in later phases.

### 2.2 WebSocket Client ✅ COMPLETE

## KEY DECISIONS LOG

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single process, dual executors** - Efficient, shared data/OB detection
- **Config-driven** - All parameters in JSON, no hardcoded values
- **State persistence** - OBs and positions saved to JSON
- **Recovery via historical rebuild** - Safer than relying on saved state alone

### Trading Logic Decisions
- **Entry Mode A:** Wait for candle close, then market order
- **Entry Mode B:** Place limit order at OB entry (20% penetration)
- **Stop Loss:** When price closes beyond OB (invalidation)
- **Take Profit:** Partial exit at 2 ATR (50%), trail remainder
- **Position Sizing:** 40% capital + 20x leverage (fresh), 30% + 10x (breaker)
- **Max Positions:** 1 per symbol (cannot have SOL long in both modes)
- **Cooldown:** 3 candles in same direction after exit

### Technical Decisions
- **Data:** Real-time WebSocket + 6-month historical for OBs
- **Timeframe:** 15m only (for now)
- **Symbols:** SOLUSD, AAVEUSD only (for now)
- **Broker:** Delta Exchange India only
- **Deployment:** Mac Mini 24/7, auto-restart on crash

## BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Current Blockers
- None

### Known Risks
1. **API rate limits** - Delta may throttle aggressive polling
   - Mitigation: Use WebSocket, cache data
2. **WebSocket disconnects** - Network issues
   - Mitigation: Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
3. **Partial fills** - May not get full position filled
   - Mitigation: Track pending orders, handle partials
4. **Slippage** - Market orders may fill worse than expected
   - Mitigation: Track actual fill prices, adjust if needed
5. **Mac Mini failure** - Power/hardware issues
   - Mitigation: UPS, auto-restart, Telegram alerts

## NOTES & LEARNINGS

### Day 0 Notes
- Decided on single process with dual executors (more efficient)
- Git repository for version control and sharing
- Focus on SOLUSD and AAVEUSD only initially
- 15m timeframe only for simplicity

### Important Reminders
- Always test on paper before real money
- Start real money with $20 per symbol per mode
- OB detection must match backtest exactly
- Capital tracking updates after each trade P&L
